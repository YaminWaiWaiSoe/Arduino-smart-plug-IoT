# Arduino-smart-plug-IoT

Control TP-Link smart plugs with an Arduino and FireBettle Esp 32. I tested with Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug, HS100(UK) model, it also works with their other similar smart plugs since you can control most of them with your KASA account.

## Preliminary steps

In order to control the smart plugs, you need to get your TP-Link KASA token from your account, the endpoint URL for your smart plugs, and the deviceId of them as well.
